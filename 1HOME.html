    <p>Motor vehicle service or Tune-up</p>
    <p>A motor vehicle service or tune-up is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has traveled a certain distance. The service intervals are specified by the vehicle manufacturer in a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel. A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, which is the modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification, rather than using maintenance to keep the engine running as it should.

The completed services are usually recorded in a service book upon completion of each service. A complete service history usually adds to the resale value of a vehicle.</p>
<p>The actual schedule of car maintenance varies depending on the year, make, and model of a car, its driving conditions and driver behavior. Car makers recommend the so-called extreme or the ideal service schedule based on impact parameters such as

number of trips and distance traveled per trip per day
extreme hot or cold climate conditions
mountainous, dusty or DE-iced roads
heavy stop-and-go vs. long-distance cruising
towing a trailer or other heavy load
Service advisers in dealerships and independent shops recommend schedule intervals, which are often in between the ideal or extreme service schedule.</p>

    <p>Why Vehicle Maintenance is Important</p>
    <p> You have invested thousands of dollars in your vehicle, so you need to be sure to maintain your vehicle properly. This is not the only reason to take regular vehicle maintenance seriously. There are several other factors that need to be considered.</p>
    <p> Extend the Life of Your Vehicle: Just by following the regular maintenance schedule, you can keep several vehicle problems at bay. When you are traveling in your vehicle, the last thing you want is a car breakdown. Keeping up with the regular maintenance schedule can help by preventing costly repairs of the cooling system, transmission system, drivetrain and other components.  Preventive car care reduces wear and tear of the engine and other components that extend the life of your vehicle.<br></br><br></br>



Increased Safety: A car breakdown at night on a quiet road can be a dangerous situation. You can never predict what may happen when you are stranded on a quiet road. Regular maintenance reduces the probability of a car breakdown and your car will be in great condition to support your journey. Checking treads of tires and air pressure is important for your vehicle for a strong grip on the road. It also plays an important role in the comfort of the journey.<br></br><br></br>



Reduced Repair Costs: Regular maintenance doesn’t cost much but unexpected repairs and replacements can be expensive. Engine and other components don’t fail without a reason. When you neglect maintenance, it gives way to minor problems developing that can become major with continued neglect of vehicle maintenance.Regular maintenance of your vehicle gives you an opportunity to check whether there are any signs of minor problems like cracks, leaks, as well as excessive wear and tear due to friction. If you pay attention to these things and perform repairs, the specific part can be saved and you will not need a replacement for a long time. In a way, vehicle maintenance extends the longevity of the engine and other components and reduces the need for an early replacement. Thus, it helps in reducing repair costs as well.<br></br><br></br>



Here are some of the routine inspections that are part of vehicle maintenance:</br>



Fluids: Systems in your vehicle use fluids for functioning. Since they are enclosed in tight chambers, there is no risk of evaporation. However, over time, their levels deplete and the level of protection they offer against friction decreases. If you neglect vehicle maintenance, there will more wear and tear of the engine and other components, and ultimately you will be required to replace them.<<br></br>></br>



Tires: The right air pressure and proper rotation ensures equal wearing of your tires. Maintaining the correct air pressure is the easiest thing to do and you can get it done at gas station when refueling. It doesn’t take much time but it goes long way in increasing gas mileage and reducing wear and tear.<br></br><br></br>



Oil Change: It is one of the most important aspects of vehicle maintenance that you should keep your eye on. Auto experts suggest vehicle owners change their oil after every 3,000 to 5,000 miles. It is essential to maintain your engine in good condition.<br></br><br></br>



Always remember, vehicle maintenance might cost you a few hundred dollars while replacements and emergency repairs can cost thousands or more. This one factor is enough for everyone to understand the importance of vehicle maintenance.<br></br><br></br>
